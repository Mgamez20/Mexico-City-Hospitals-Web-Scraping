# Private Hospital Evaluation in Mexico City through KPIs

Final project developed during Health Data Scince Program.
By using three different KPIs (Key Perfomance Indicators) related to pacient budget, number of deaths divided by number of procedures performed and number of hospital discharges divided by the number of beds, private hospitals in Mexico City were evaluated to select the best hospital that can meet the needs of the patient.

With the existing public data in the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) and using Web Scraping libraries, such as Selenium in Python, as well as data from the MGS Asesoría Patrimonial y Fiscal, qualifications, opinions, latitudes and lengths of private hospitals from Google Maps.

A database was created with all the information obtained and from this database a dashboard was developed in Tableu so that the end user (patient) can access the information and compare private hospitals, in order to make a decision based on in data. Likewise, if the end user (patient) can approach MGS Asesoría Patrimonial y Fiscal to learn about the various health insurance plans offered by this firm.
